REMIRA 02/01/2023 - current

Remira Italia is a company specializing in various IT services, ranging from product development to consultancy services. I joined Remira as a consultant for the development of web applications.

1. Initial Training Period
During the initial period, I underwent training in the proper development of backend and frontend projects. The backend training focused on developing RESTful APIs using .NET. The frontend training covered the React.js framework, specifically using TypeScript.


2. MDSourcing
The project involved a web application requested by a private citizen. The application was an e-commerce website for selling plants and trees.

Stack:
- React TypeScript
- Bootstrap
- .NET 5
- Entity Framework
- Git

Challenges and Objectives:
My role was to maintain the application and add new features. This project marked my first experience with React.


3. EUI - Salary Calculette
I joined the European University Institute (EUI) as an external consultant. I was assigned to the Salary Calculette project, a web application designed to calculate employee salaries and facilitate communication between the HR and BFA offices regarding contracts.

Stack:
- React TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- .NET 7
- Entity Framework
- PostgreSQL
- Docker
- Git
- Azure

Challenges and Objectives:
This was the first project I was involved in from the beginning. I closely followed the initial analysis and project foundation creation. Additionally, I developed almost the entire project myself. The project received increasingly positive feedback, significantly simplifying major work operations, reducing time and costs.
