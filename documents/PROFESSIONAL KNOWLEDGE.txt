PROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE 

As mentioned in my professional experience, my skills have a range that cover both frontend and backend technologies.
As a backend developer I've worked mostly with .NET frameworks, gaining the expertize needed to fully develop RESTful APIs.
During my career I put extra attention in frontend technologies, with the goal of being an expert in javascript, with all its versions (such as jQuery and Vanilla JS) and its frameworks/libraries (typescript, React, Angular, Vue, NextJs).
In my frontend project I've worked with different types of graphic libraries, such as Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS. I've also worked a lot with basic CSS, creating styles and animations.

For versioning my project I've always used Git. For deploying I've used Docker and Azure.

I gained a lot of skills through personal studies and personal projects I've worked on. In this way I managed to grow my knowledge without the necessity of a professional experience, but following my simple curiosity. Technologies that I've learnt this way and that I want to mention are:
- JS frameworks
- AWS cloud services
- PHP
