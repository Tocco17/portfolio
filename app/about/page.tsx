			<p>
				My name is Federico. I was born in Bagno a Ripoli in 1996. 
				Experts in anthropology confirm that it was a great year.

				I am a physicist working as a developer. 
				You could say that I chose a job where I am constantly 
				surrounded by the number one enemy of a physicist: engineers!

				I live in Florence.

				I have always pursued scientific studies: 
				I attended a science-oriented high school 
				and then enrolled at the University of Florence, 
				in the School of Physics and Astrophysics.

				After graduating, I found a job as a programmer, 
				a job I still do today.
