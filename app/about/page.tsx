		<h2>About page</h2>

		<p>
			My name is Federico. I live in Florence but I was born in Bagno a Ripoli in 1996.
			Experts in anthropology confirm that it was a great year!
		</p>

		<p>
			I am a physicist working as a developer.
			You could say that I chose a job where I am constantly
			surrounded by the number one enemy of a physicist: engineers!
		</p>

		<p>
			I have always pursued scientific studies:
			I attended a science-oriented high school
			and then enrolled at the University of Florence,
			in the School of Physics and Astrophysics.
		</p>

		<p>
			After graduating, I found a job as a programmer,
			a job I still do today.
