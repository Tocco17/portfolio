			I enrolled at the University of Florence, School of Physics and Astrophysics.
		</p>

		<p>
			My first approach to computer science was at the university.
			Among the mandatory first-year courses was an informatics course where they taught C.
			I immediately liked the subject, so much so that I almost immediately started studying it on my own.
			On the advice of developer friends, I soon began studying C#.
		</p>

		<p>
			I graduated in 2021, defending a thesis on Recommended Systems.
			A brief description of Recommended Systems: these are models aimed at analyzing a population to predict their behaviors.
			These systems are ubiquitous today, especially used on e-commerce sites due to their nature.
			As the name suggests, they aim to recommend specific products to people by analyzing various factors,
			such as the time of year, age, gender, the culture of the surrounding population,
			and their behavior within the same e-commerce site.
			I wrote the various models I studied using Matlab.
		</p>

		<p>
			After graduating, I quickly found a job as a software developer.
