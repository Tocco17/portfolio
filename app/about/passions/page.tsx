			<p>
				I am a person with many passions, following the rule "You can't say it's bad until you've tried it."
				According to this philosophy, I still want and need to give pineapple pizza a chance,
				despite my Italian blood obliging me to be disgusted by it.

				I have been practicing Karate since 2010.
				I grew up in the society I am still part of today: Bushido Karate ASD.
				For a period, I taught this discipline to children aged 5/6 and up.
				I am part of the council, taking on various responsibilities, including:
				<ul>
					<li>General organization of the society (legislative and bureaucratic)</li>
					<li>Enrollment management</li>
					<li>Organization of sporting events</li>
					<li>Safeguarding policies manager</li>
					<li>Certified BDSM: first aid intervention</li>
				</ul>

				I have been playing the drums since 2021
				and have been passionate about music even before I was in my parents' thoughts.
				Always looking for a new concert to attend!

			<p>
				When it comes to the classic "sea or mountains" question, I choose the place with the most beautiful scenery!
				That it usually coincides with the mountains is just a coincidence...
				Although I am passionate about hiking and trekking,
				I currently only have the "Via degli Dei" on the list of "challenging routes completed."
				But I have many other routes planned!
				In general, I enjoy traveling, whether in company or solo.
				I love getting lost in the streets of cities I am exploring for the first time.
				I have often ended up in extremely peculiar places this way!
			</p>

			<p>
				I have had a B driver's license since 2016 and an A license since 2023.
